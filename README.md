## Description

For this project, I was tasked with building a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions featuring HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. This quiz is meant to help familiarize me with a typical coding assessment that I may be asked to complete at some point in my coding journey (possibly a job interview).

The site starts on an instructional page for the game. The game starts when the Start Quiz button is clicked. There are 8 multiple choice questions you are taken through, and each question has 4 answer choices. When you click an answer choice, you are brought to the next question and told whether you asnwered correctly or incorrectly on the last question. An incorrect answer will penalize your time by 10 seconds. A correct answer will gain you 5 points. There's 40 points total that you can earn. The game ends when the last question has been answered or time runs out. You will then be prompted to enter your initials to be submitted to a high score list. After submitting your initials, you will be brought to the high score list where you will see your initials with its score. The list of high scores has been cut off at a top 5. From the high scores page, you can either clear your list of high scores with the Clear Highscores buttn, or go back to the instruction page with the Go Back button. There is also a View Highscores button in the top left corner that can be clicked at any time, and it will take you to the high score list.
